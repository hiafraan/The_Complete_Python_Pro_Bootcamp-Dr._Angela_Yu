# Python Pro Bootcamp Projects

This repository contains the projects I completed as part of the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" course, taught by Dr. Angela Yu.

## Course Description

The "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" is an in-depth and comprehensive course that covers a wide range of topics in Python programming. Through hands-on projects and exercises, I learned how to build web applications, work with data and databases, and create data visualizations using Python.
